This tool will convert **any** integrer to a roman numeral provided it's not too large or negative and also it may fail.

    npm install roman-numeral-convert

    const augustus = require('roman-numeral-convert');
    augustus(19); /*XIX*/

You can also use it as a cli tool because why would you not want that i mean this is so useful

    sudo npm install roman-numeral-convert -g

    roman-numeral-convert 19
