This tool will convert **any** integrer to a roman numeral provided it's not too large or negative and also it may fail.

  npm install roman-numeral-converter
  
  const augustus = require('roman-numeral-converter');
  augustus(19); /*XIX*/
  
You can also use it as a cli tool because why would you not want that i mean this is so useful

  sudo npm install roman-numeral-converter -g
  
  romannumeral 19
